# InstaBot
This project is an automation tool for Instagram activities which allows the user to potentially get more followers with minimal manual effort. The bot uses Selenium framework to navigate through a browser and currently it is capable of following actions:
- Sign in
- Like the photos
- Follow the users
## To Do
In the future the project will be developed to introduce new functions. There will be added AI system based on Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize the content of an image and classifying if it's worth to like or not. Also there will be added a database with followed users and the dates when they were followed so it will be possible to automatically unfollow then after certain amount of time.
